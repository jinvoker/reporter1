<b><i>Reporter</i></b> is a simple Unix/linux system information reporting tool. In simple terms it is serves as a 'screenshot program'. Reporter is aimed to remain simple,fast and minimalistic with merely under 50 lines of code, it is also designed in such a way that the workings are clear to a newbie bash user and to invite more people to join the development.   

Akin to already existing screenshot programs, Reporter borrows aesthetic appeal  from programs such as screenfetch and neofetch, however all of the code is completely written from scratch.


Hereâ€™s how reporter looks on Linux Mint:

### WORKINGS
### It's simple !


Understanding what's in the code is essential to know how the code is implemented and also to contribute back in ways, if you would like to.
The picture below might give an overview of the code within. The script is divided and highlighted into two sections, the secion in blue shows the logic of the bash script to be displayed later in the green section. For eg., the  line of code underlined (in red) in the blue section is the same code to be displayed in the green section(underlined in red as well).
